Self-directed project on a fraud detection pipeline on the IEEE-CIS dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 590,540 transactions and 430+ features. Merged identity and transaction files joined by TransactionID, removed columns with more than 90% nulls, and high-cardinality features (>50). Feature-engineered a preprocessing pipeline, ensuring missing values are filled, numeric features are scaled, and categorical features are encoded. Trained a Logistic Regression model and integrated it using a Pipeline for deployability. The model identified 73% of all fraud cases in this linear model, with high false positives, and achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.78. For future iterations, experiment with non-linear models, as fraud patterns are non-linear and involve complex features.
